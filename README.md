# About Me

Hello, I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in Linux systems, low-level software, and open-source technologies. I enjoy working close to the system and often build and experiment with custom configurations, lightweight environments, and alternative operating systems.

I have hands-on experience with a variety of tools, frameworks, and languages, including:

- **Languages & Web Tech**: Haskell, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, XML
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Operating Systems**: Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, Qubes OS, Ubuntu
- **Tools**: Neovim, Tmux, LaTeX, Git, Bash

## Projects

### Match the Flag
A browser-based flag identification game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. Designed to test and improve geographic knowledge through interactive play.

## Interests

- Linux customization and system internals
- Lightweight and minimalist computing
- Security-conscious systems (e.g., Qubes OS)
- Web development with a focus on simplicity and function
- Exploring programming paradigms (especially functional programming through Haskell)
